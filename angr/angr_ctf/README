Eventually, this README will have information about building, installing, and 
playing the levels.

Currently, if you want to play around with them, take a look at package.py,
which builds the levels, and dist/ which generally has an up-to-date build
of each of the levels.

A Makefile is included that performs an automated build for both a local
  installation and for the MetaCTF web installation.  A list of users
  is passed in via the USERS environment variable which will then build
  the binaries for each user listed.

Build binaries in obj/{foo,bar}/angr
  make USERS='foo bar' local

Build binaries in upper-level MetaCTF repo ../www/static/obj/{foo,bar}/angr
  make USERS='foo bar' web
